# 2. Installation

To create the project from the template you need to install cookiecutter and follow these instructions.


## Prerequisites

Before installing Cookiecutter, please make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

To check if Python is installed on a machine, open a terminal or command prompt like `git bash` and type:

```bash
python --version
```
This will display the version number of Python, if it is installed.

To check if pip is installed, you can run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
```bash
pip --version
```
If pip is installed, this command will display the version number. If pip is not installed, you will receive an error message.


## 2.1 Install cookiecutter

- **Install cookiecutter**
  Installing cookiecutter package is very easy, you can simply run the next command to install it.
  ```
  python -m pip install cookiecutter
  ```

  > **Note**  
  > It is recommended to create and activate a virtual environment to install the libraries

- **Follow this step if you don't have pypi as trusted host permanently**

  If you don't have access to pypi, you can install cookiecutter with the following flags:
  ```bash
  pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org cookiecutter
  ```

  Or set the repositories as trusted in the global configuration parameters with the following command and then do the installation.

  ```bash
  pip config set global.trusted-host "pypi.org files.pythonhosted.org pypi.python.org"
  ```

## 2.2 Download the custom template

To generate a custom project from the template, follow these steps:
- 1. Navigate to the path where you desire to generate the project folder.
- 2. Run the cookiecutter command followed by the repository URL.
  ```
  python -m cookiecutter https://github.com/charlstown/site-template.git
  ```
- 3. Fill out the form in the console and the project will be generated at the end.

# 3. Usage

## 3.1 Install the requirements

You can install the requirements for the project by running the command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Remember that if you didn't set the pypi as trusted host globally in the previous step, you can add the following flags to the command.
```
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org -r requirements.txt
```
## 3.2 Test run

After setting up the template, you can do a test run.

Serve the site locally running this command.
```
mkdocs serve -w overrides/
```

You may add the flag '-a localhost:8080' to select a custom local port.
