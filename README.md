- __`status`__: Contains the labels with the different status of the issue.

# 3. Usage

## 3.1 Install the requirements

You can install the requirements for the project by running the command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Remember that if you didn't set the pypi as trusted host globally in the previous step, you can add the following flags to the command.
```
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org -r requirements.txt
```


## 3.2 Test run

After setting up the template, you can do a test run.

Serve the site locally running this command.
```bash
mkdocs serve -w overrides/
```

You may add the flag '-a localhost:8080' to select a custom local port.

## 3.3  Adding the project to a new Github repository

- **Step 1: Create a new repository in github:**

  Create the new repository and make sure you give it the same name of the project folder, in our case my-cool-site.

  > **Warning**
  > Don't add any predefined file from github in the new repository, all the files are included in the local project folder.

- **step 2: Push the local repository:**

  ```bash
  git remote add origin {{LINK TO YOUR EMPTY REPO}}
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  ```
