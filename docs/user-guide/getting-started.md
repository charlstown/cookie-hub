## 2. Installation

To create a new project from the template you need to install cookiecutter and follow these instructions.

### 2.1 Requirements

- A Command-line interface like Git Bash or Terminal.
- An IDE like VSCode, Pycharm, Spyder, etc.

### 2.2 Cookiecutter installation

Installing cookiecutter package on Ubuntu or on Windows with Git bash is very easy, you can simply run the next command to install it.

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

Visit the link to the [cookiecutter documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#install-cookiecutter) to learn more about the installation.

??? note "Install cookiecutter in a virtual environment"

    It is recommended to create a virtual environment and, install the cookiecutter library inside this environment.


### 2.3 Custom site generation

To generate a custom project from the template, follow these steps:

<div class="steps" markdown>
- **Choose a place to generate the project**

    Navigate to the path where you desire to generate the project folder.
    ```bash
    cd /my-projects
    ```
    
    !!! note ""

        There is no need to create a specific folder for your project, cookiecutter will create the repository folder for you.

- **Select the template**
    
    Run the cookiecutter command followed by the template repository URL.
    ```bash
    python -m cookiecutter https://github.com/charlstown/cookie-site.git
    ```

- **Customize the template**

    Fill out the form in the console to customize the template and the project will be generated at the end.

    !!! note ""
        You can accept the default answer in the form by pressing `Enter`.

    You should see a new folder with the repository name you gave as input.

- **Deploy & test your project locally**

    Go to your generated project folder, install the requirements and, deploy your project locally by running these commands.

    ```bash
    cd my-cool-site
    pip install -r requirements
    python -m mkdocs serve -w overrides/
    ```

Congrats! :fireworks: You finally generated your own Documentation Site!

### 2.5 [Optional] Adding the project to a new Github repository

<div class="steps" markdown>

- **Create a new repository in github:**

    Create the new repository and ==**make sure you name it with the same name of the project folder**==, in our case `my-cool-site`.
    
    !!! warning

        Don't add any predefined file from github in the new repository, all the files are included in the local project folder.

- **Push the local repository:**

    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/charlstown/my-python-project.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

    ??? note

        After pushing the project the github action `On Push Deploy Documentation` will create a new branch called `gh-pages`.
        This branch contains the documentation files in html ready to be published in Github Pages.

</div>

### 2.6 [Optional] Deploying the documentation in Github Pages

Deploy your documentation in Github pages is so easy, you only need to set the pages configuration pointing at the `gh-pages` branch generated by our github action `On Push Deploy Documentation`.


!!! warning

    To deploy the documentation in Github Pages the repository must be a public repository.

<div class="steps" markdown>

- Go to the repository settings.
- Select `Pages` at the settings menu under the `code and automation` section.
- Make sure pages is enable and select `gh-pages` as the site branch under `Build and deployment` section.

    ![gh-pages settings](/assets/images/captures/gs-ghpages-settings.png)

- Go to the code and automation section in setting, actions/general.
    ![nav-actions](/assets/images/captures/ug-getting-started-nav-actions.png)

- Make sure you have activate the `Read and write permissions` in the Workflow permissions section.
    ![workflow-permissions](/assets/images/captures/ug-getting-started-workflow-permissions.png)

Your site should be live at: `https://youruser.github.io/my-cool-site/``
